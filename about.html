                        James Eardley has been fishing since he could walk. Some of his earliest memories are of fishing with his dad.
                        James is an accomplished fisherman. He has fished for everything from steelhead in the great Northwest to jack crevale in Mexico. 
                        James is from St. George, Utah.  He is currently a student at Brigham Young University, where he has studied fly fishing. 
                        He has a great love for the outdoors. He respects the environment and is careful to catch and release his fish.  
                        James has a delightful personality and his humor will keep the day fun for all. Most recently, James returned from
                        a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  He served the people of the Baltic States and speaks Russian.
                        James is a great mentor and will provide a memorable, fun fishing trip for you and your group.
